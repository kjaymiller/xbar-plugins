# Jays xbar Plugins
A Repository of xbar plugins for project created by jay.

## Python Instructions
You will need to replace the path in the shebang line with the path to your python executable. 
I noticed it did not like virtual environments. So any imports will need to be installed at the user level.


## How to Use
Copy the file to your project directory.

To ensure syncing between this project and xbar you should link the files
`ln pod_sync.6h.py "$HOME/LibraryApplication Support/xbar/plugins"
